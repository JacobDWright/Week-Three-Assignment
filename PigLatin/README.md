OK, so here is the second lab for the week.  

Write a program to the following specifications:
The program should prompt the user to enter an English word to translate into Pig Latin
The program should translate the word in to Pig Latin, given the following rules:  
The program should print the translated word.

The rules for Pig Latin (this version)

If a word begins with a vowel, append 'yay' to the end of the word.
If a word begins in a consonant, remove all the consonants from the beginning of the word, 
up to the first vowel, and append them to the end of the word. Finally, append 'ay' to the end of the word.  
Divide and conquer should be your approach to handling this lab. 
Create a framework of comments for each spec. 
Create the input loop and the test for the sentinel character. (".")
Have the loop look at each letter of the word and decide if its a consonant or a vowel.
Build a new word, starting with an empty string "" and appending characters as needed.
